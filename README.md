# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_POPULAR_MOVIES_DATA

In collaboration with UNP, I developed the Popular Movies Dashboard, offering insights into movie trends and performance metrics. The dashboard analyzes movie genres, ratings, and revenue, highlighting top-rated and highest-grossing films. It explores user engagement, popular tags, and genres, providing a data-driven approach to understanding successful movie factors. This enables informed content recommendations and business decisions in the film industry.
